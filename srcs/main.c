/*
** 	Push-Swap is an application that arrange a sequence of numbers
** starting from the lowest number in a crescent way.
**
** 	The main funcion is responsible to start the application, while receiving 
** the name of the application and an argument;
** 	EX: ./push_swap "5 6 4 3 2 1 0"
**
**
** 	The first step is related to the validation of the argument received
** and if the argument is correctly inputed, it will populate the stack 'a'
**  with the list of numbers;
** 	The next step consist in calling the parsing funcion which is responsible
** for knowing the list's size which will serve as base to better parse 
** the algorithm logic.
**
** 	This application will use 2 stacks that can be used to swap its numbers 
** to arrange the list;
** 	Also, it was given some operations that must be used as
** they were described.
** 	Please, find below the operations allowed:
** - sa :swap 'a' - swap the first 2 elements at the top of stack 'a';
** - sb :swap 'b' - swap the first 2 elements at the top of stack 'b';
** - ss :sa and sb at the same time.
** - pa :push 'a' - take the first element at the top of 'b' and
** put it at the top of 'a'.
** - pb :push 'b' - take the first element at the top of 'a' and
** put it at the top of 'b'.
** - ra :rotate 'a' - shift up all elements of stack 'a' by 1.
** - rb :rotate 'b' - shift up all elements of stack 'b' by 1.
** - rr :ra and rb at the same time.
** - rra :reverse rotate 'a' - shift down all elements of stack 'a' by 1.
** - rrb :reverse rotate 'b' - shift down all elements of stack 'b' by 1;
** - rrr :rra and rrb at the same time.
**
**
** 	The result is the sequence of operations executed by the application
** to arrange the list of numbers.
